"# Energy-Efficient-Routing-Protocol-for-Wireless-Sensor-Networks" 
The proposed protocol includes five phases:  
(1) set-up phase which comprises of area division and one-hop neighbour node pairing, 
(2) sleep scheduling phase,
(3) cluster head selection phase, 
(4) minimum spanning tree formation phase,
(5) data transmission phase
